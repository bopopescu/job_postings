Achieving these goals will be challenging, but we know we can do it. Here&rsquo;s why:<br /><br /><strong>A strong founder team</strong><br />We, the founders, have a proven track record of building successful companies from scratch. We will take all of the amazing and painful experiences of the past and apply them to create a company we all will be very proud of.<br /><br /><strong>Self-funded</strong><br />The founders have invested $10 million to allow us to focus on building technology and product the right way. Our eyes are on the goals of building a global technology platform. We are laser focused on customer needs, but will make product priorities based on our long-term goals, not short-term revenue.<br /><br /><strong>Remote-first</strong><br />We believe technology that enables remote work to be&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;than a corporate office setting is already here and the world of business is just about to catch up. Remote work certainly comes with drawbacks, but the strongly believe the advantages vastly outnumber the disadvantages. Speaking to dozens of experienced remote employees has shown us that the number one obstacle to building a successful remote workplace is doing it half-way by having some people be co-located and some remote. We want the same mode of collaboration for&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;and our team will be working remotely most of the time.<br /><br />This does not mean that you have to work from home all the time, or at all. Motiion will pay for co-working space if that&rsquo;s what you prefer. We will also encourage team members that live in the same area to meet up and work together when it makes sense. We will also make sure we all meet regularly for real in-person interaction!<br /><br /><strong>Personal impact of collaborating individuals</strong><br />We have seen first-hand how corporate culture can devolve into empire building and reporting lines. Motiion will have great managers, but we recognize and value the skills of individual contributors. You can grow your career at Motiion doing the work you love and excel at.

The Program is strongly connected to the international academic community, placing emphasis on transdisciplinary synergies and applied approaches. Accurate and reliable spatially explicit information on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and in particular its anthropogenic use, is at the crux of our need to understand our changing planet and to be able to create biophysical and economic models with reliable input and calibration data. However, it is exactly this information that has been shown to be highly inaccurate over many areas of the globe and across multiple sectors.</p><br /><p>Hence the Center for Earth Observation &amp; Citizen Science (EOCS) Research Group has built and deployed tools and platforms to use citizen science, crowdsourcing and expert knowledge in order to improve in-situ data and the overall information base of land cover and land use globally via product integration and geospatial approaches. One of the tools is the geo-wiki.org platform for visualizing and collecting land-use information. This and other citizen science and crowdsourcing tools need new graphical designs and front-end development.</p><br /><p><strong>The position:</strong></p><br /><p>The successful candidate will work closely with our team to design and realize modern web applications to showcase R&amp;D activities.

Within the Sanger Institute, you will have also access to global specialists in genomics with decades of experience discovering new disease genes, who are already exploring these data.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>The Wellcome Sanger Institute is a charitably funded research centre and committed to training the next generation of genome scientists. Focused on understanding the role of genetics in health and disease and a world leader in the genomic revolution, our mission is to use genome sequences to advance understanding of human and pathogen biology in order to improve human health. We aim to provide results that can be translated into diagnostics, treatments or therapies that reduce global health burdens. Our science is large-scale and organised into Programmes, led by our Faculty who conceive and deliver our science, and supported by our Scientific Operations teams responsible for all data production pipelines at the Institute.</p><br /><p><strong>COSMIC</strong></p><br /><p>A revolution is underway in health informatics, with genetics increasingly important in understanding human health and disease. COSMIC (<a href=\"http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/</a>), a database of genetic mutations in cancer, is a major resource in cancer research, used by over 4000 scientists every day across the informatics, diagnostic and pharmaceutical industries.
